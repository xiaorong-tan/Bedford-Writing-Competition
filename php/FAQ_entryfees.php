echo "<p class='question'>Q: How much does it cost to enter the competition?</p>

    <p class='answer'>A: The normal entry fee is £5 per story (or poem). If three stories (or poems) are submitted on the same entry form then the fee will be £10, a £5 saving. If you qualify as a full-time student then the fee is £3 per story (or poem), there is no reduction for multiple entries.</p>

    <p class='question'>Q: Who qualifies for a reduced entry fee?</p>

    <p class='answer'>A: This will apply to full time students. Evidence of qualification may be asked for by the competition organisers.</p>

    <p class='question'>Q: I have already entered one story (or poem) and now I want to enter two more. Will I still be able to enter 'three for the price of two'?</p>

    <p class='answer'>A: No. To qualify for 'three for the price of two' all three stories (or poems) must be submitted on the same entry form.</p>"
