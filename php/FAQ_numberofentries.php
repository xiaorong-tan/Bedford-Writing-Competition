	<p class="question">Q: Is there a limit to the number of stories (or poems) I can submit?</p>

    <p class="answer">A: You can submitting as many stories (or poems) as you like but please remember to take advantage of the 'three for the price of two' by ensuring that three stories (or poems) are submitted using one entry form.</p>

    <p class="question">Q: If I submit my entry by post, will I still qualify for 'three for the price of two'?</p>

    <p class="answer">A: Yes. Three stories (or poems) can be submitted using the entry form that can be downloaded for postal entries.</p>
