echo "<p class='question'>Q: How will the judging take place?</p>

    <p class='answer'>A: Every story (or poem) will be considered for inclusion in a short-list by a panel of readers. Short-listed stories and poems will be assessed by a judge appointed to each competition, who will decide on the stories or poems winning first, second and third prize.</p>

    <p class='question'>Q: Will the readers or judge know the identity of the author?</p>

    <p class='answer'>A: No. All judging is done anonymously. There must be nothing in or attached to the story (or poem) that indicates who the author is.</p>";
