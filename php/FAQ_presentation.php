echo "<p class='question'>Q: Why does my story have to be in a certain font, with double line spacing and each page carrying a title and page number?</p>

    <p class='answer'>A: It is important that stories are easy to read. Using the correct font and double line spacing enables this. It is also important that the story remains intact which is the reason for each page carrying the title and page number.</p>

    <p class='question'>Q: Can I illustrate my story (or poem) with pictures?</p>

    <p class='answer'>A: No. Having pictures or diagrams embedded in the story (or poem) is not allowed.</p>";
